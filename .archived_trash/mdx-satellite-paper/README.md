### How to write an article

All submissions are created via markdown files and uses the same template and syntax as in the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html). An example paper can be seen in [paper.md].

3. Clone this new repository into your desktop environment

10. The pull request will be closed when the paper is accepted and published.

### How to preview and article

All markdown papers are automatically compiled to PDF using a github action service. This can be used to preview the PDF before submission. Look for the `paper` artifacts of the `Paper Draft`.
